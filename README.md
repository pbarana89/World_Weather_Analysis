# World_Weather_Analysis

* The overview of this project was to combine our work with the OpenWeatherMap to help travelers find destinations that best fit their needs and give them local hotels in those areas. We took that a step further by also creating a possible travel itinerary if they were wanting to go to different locations. We accomplished this project by using the API from OpenWeatherMap and Google APIs to find weather between an acceptable temperature of 70 and 95 degrees fahreneit. 

## Database Example

* Here is an example of the search from 70 to 95 degrees. As you can see as this information was pulled in January 2022, most of the locations are in the southern hemisphere. As much as people love snow and cold weather, this is not often the ideal weather wanted by travelers. The system could easily find information for locations that fit those criteria as well.

* We have chosen to use an example of a trip created on the Southeastern coast of Australia and as you can see, we are able to help travelers visualize and see what a trip could look like, which being able to see the idea makes them much more likely to book the trip.

* Finally, we added markers that showed the hotel information for each leg of the trip as well as current weather conditions.

### Conclusion
We were able to combine two very powerful APIs to enhance the choices for prospective clients that are looking to book trips. We could take the power of Google APIs even further and show clients possible restaurants and landmarks that could just help them become more likely to book with us and then use us in the future.
